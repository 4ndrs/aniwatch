# AniWatch

This is a small project I decided to create for learning purposes, specifically for learning/refreshing the following content:

- GraphQL + codegen usage
- Redux RTK Query for client side fetching
- Storybook for building UI components in isolation
- Altair for exploring the GraphQL API & Docs

The project uses AniList's GraphQL API, as well as the site's design as a reference. It looks nice, but it was not meant to be used, you will get a better experience in the official [AniList site](https://anilist.co/search/anime?sort=SCORE_DESC).
